# hashm
hashm is created by r.n completely using c++
For help of this program use 'hashm --help'
FOR THE FIRST COMMAND you need to type 'hashm' for the others which comes with '--direct' or '--main' YOU DO NOT NEED TO TYPE 'hashm'
note: IT DOES NOT CONTAIN MALWARE , it only has a SHUTDOWN command which is activated when a users types 'hashm --virus --darkhashm --shutdown'
NOTE the virus command is a joke an only leads to darkhashm.
the code is simple and i tried to comment every where needed. the '--passcheck', '--internet' ,'--specs'(source mentioned at the end of its section) along with the hash creations are not mine.
# logins
to login as admin use 'hashm --login admin admin'
and to create users use 'hashm --register [username] [password] [repeated password]
I had them saved as cool code along time ago without any sources hence i do not have the link and source.
# the code only works in windows 
NOTE: Everything else is written by yours truly.





ps: i put A LOT of effort in this code. and I am sorry if the code is a bit messed up. I am NOT a pro at c++ and it is 3 months that i have started learning it.
