# hashm
hashm is created by r.n completely using c++
the code is simple and i tried to comment every where needed. the '--passcheck', '--internet' ,'--specs'(source mentioned at the end of its section) along with the hash creations are not mine.
I had them saved as cool code along time ago without any sources hence i do not have the link and source.
This only works with "Windows".
NOTE: Everything else is written by yours truly.
ps: i put A LOT of effort in this code. and I am sorry if the code is a bit messed up. I am NOT a pro at c++ and it is 3 months that i have started learning it.
